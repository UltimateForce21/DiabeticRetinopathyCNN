# DiabeticRetinopathyCNN
A CNN model trained to distinguish between the classes of diabetic retinopathy.

The Final model the team established is [finalmodel.ipynb](./finalmodel.ipynb).

The various test models that were tested on and gradually improved can be found in the folder [tested_models](./tested_models).

To run any notebook, first download the necessary datasets to train the model from the following:
1. [APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/aptos2019-blindness-detection)
2. [Diabetic Retinopathy Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/diabetic-retinopathy-detection)
3. [Messidor-2 DR Grades](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/google-brain/messidor2-dr-grades)
